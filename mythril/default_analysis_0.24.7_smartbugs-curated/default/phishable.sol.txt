==== Dependence on tx.origin ====

Use of tx.origin as a part of authorization control.
The tx.origin environment variable has been found to influence a control flow decision. Note that using tx.origin as a security control might cause a situation where a user inadvertently authorizes a smart contract to perform an action on their behalf. It is recommended to use msg.sender instead.

The value of the call is dependent on balance or storage write
This can lead to race conditions. An attacker may be able to run a transaction after our transaction which can change the value of the call

Any sender can withdraw Ether from the contract account.
Arbitrary senders other than the contract creator can profitably extract Ether from the contract account. Verify the business logic carefully and make sure that appropriate security controls are in place to prevent unexpected loss of funds.
